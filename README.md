## Introduction

The **Simon Game** is a memory skill game inspired by the classic electronic game released in the late 1970s. The objective of the game is to replicate the sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game as it becomes progressively longer and more complex.

This project is a modern implementation of the Simon Game, created as a fun way to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key to begin the game.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: The game will highlight a random sequence of colors. Pay close attention to the order.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the colors in the exact same order as shown.
4. **Progression**: Each round adds one additional color to the sequence.
5. **Mistakes**: If you click the wrong color, the game will end. Restart and try to beat your previous score!

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engaging user interface with color highlights and sounds.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Sequences grow longer and more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current round and best score.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
